## Discord Rich Presence for 010 Editor

# Usage

Run main.py while running Discord and 010 Editor. It is better to close up the script and open it back on, when you closed 010Editor, until I fix the loop.

<b>ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS!</b>

# What does it look like

People can track what byte you are working on at the moment.
